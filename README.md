## MergeCSV
Small python script for ASU BIO-310 research to merge both .csv files into the single one needed.

#### To install:
1. [Download the repo](https://github.com/rsimmons1127/MergeCSV/archive/master.zip)
2. Unzip the download to desired location

#### To use:
1. If you have Python installed, mergeCSV.py can be ran directly. Otherwise run mergeCSV.exe from the MergeCSV folder
2. Once running, you will be prompted to select the 2 files to merge. Navigate to the folder, select both (CTRL+click), and click 'open'
3. The script will go through both files, increment the time values of the second, removes unneeded lines, and change the headings. It will then create a single file called 'merged.csv' in the same directory as the originals. *If a 'merged.csv' file already existed it will be overwritten.

#### Issues
This is NOT a general purpose script and is written very specifically for this research group. It's not much use to anyone else. If you run into any errors or have questions, please email me or submit an issue on here.
